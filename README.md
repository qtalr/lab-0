- Read/ annotate: [Recipe \#0](https://qtalr.com/resources/recipes/recipe-00/). You can refer back to this document to help you at any point during this lab activity.

## Objectives

- Access a lab activity
- Create, edit, and export a Quarto document as a report
- Demonstrate your ability to use some of the basic Markdown syntax
- Learn the submission process.

## Instructions

### Getting started

1. Create a Quarto document using the RStudio toolbar

- Provide the title: "Lab 00: Writing with code"
- Provide the author: \<Your Name\>

2. Render the Quarto document (without changes)

- Click the 'Render' button on the RStudio toolbar
- Save the Quarto file with the name `lab-00.qmd`.

### Exploring Quarto

1. In your own words, respond to the following questions in your `.qmd` document:

- What is Literate Programming?
- What is Quarto?

In your responses use various [options provided by the basic Markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) to format your response (i.e. headers, bold, italics, lists, links, _etc_.)

_Remember: you can preview your work at any time by clicking the 'Render' button in the RStudio toolbar_

2. Render the `.qmd` as a PDF. Use the `format:` key atrribute to have the value `pdf`.

3. (optional) Explore adding a code block and some R code to your R Markdown document

- You can copy and paste code from Recipe #0 to get you started.
- Try and manipulate the code block options (i.e. hiding code and/ or output), for example.

## Assessing your progress

1. Add a section which describes your learning in this lab

Some questions to consider:
